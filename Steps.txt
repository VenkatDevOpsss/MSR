         ** We need to conncet the all servers through SSH Connection So First set the SSH Conncetion Between the Servers(Remote/Client/Other)



         Ansible:
                         #sudo apt-get update
                         #sudo apt-get install software-properties-common


         **  Once the package is installed, we can add the Ansible    PPA by typing the following command:

                         #sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

         **  We need to refresh our system’s package index so that it is aware              of the packages available in the PPA

                         #sudo apt-get update
                         #sudo apt-get install ansible
